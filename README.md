# Cyclistic Case Study
## Performed By: Timothy Morales
# Introduction
This case study serves as a capstone project to Google's 6 month Data Analytics Certification Course. It intends to showcase proficiency in SQL, Tableau, and Spreadsheets. For this project, I will assume the role of a data analyst working on the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a fictional Chicago-based bike-share company. The director of the marketing department believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. My team has therefore been tasked with answering several key business questions and gaining insights that will help to design a new marketing strategy intended to convert casual riders into annual members. My team's recommendations will be presented to the executive team for approval and will be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. Specifically, my task is to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. To do so, I will analyze four quarters of 2019 bike trip data using SQL, organize my findings with Spreadsheets, and create visualizations of my discoveries with Tableau. From there, I will suggest several recommendations to help the overall marketing goal.
